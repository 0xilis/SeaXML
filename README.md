# SeaXML

My *OLD* bad plist parser from 3 years ago. Only re-uploaded for preservation, please don't use.

I created this when learning C for my now abandoned project, Buttermilk. I have considered returning to Buttermilk over the years, but never have, at least at the time of writing this.
This was coming from Python / JavaScript, so the jump from C was pretty big. Because of this, it's pretty buggy.
